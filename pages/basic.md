title: Basic Plotting

Basic Plotting
--------------

Plotting using PlPLotLib involves several basic steps that must be taken
for the process to succeed. For a single line plot, the steps taken are
the following:

	1. Initialize the library (call setup)
	2. Create a figure (call figure)
	3. Specify the subplot (call subplot)
	4. Specify axis ranges (call xylim)
	5. Plot the data (call plot)
	6. Draw axis ticks and numeric labels (call ticks)
	7. Label the axes and subplot (call labels)

The same basic process is followed for all plot types. The most common
variations from these step are the inclusion of more than one plot and
the creation of a legend to distinguish between plots.
