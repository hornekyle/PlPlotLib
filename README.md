PlPlotLib is a wrapper for PlPlot inspired by the interface of 
matplotlib. It is intended to fill the need for rapid feedback while 
developing numerical simulations, and does not replace more 
sophisticated packages such as
matplotlib or even direct use of PlPlot.

While it is possible that the output from PlPlotLib may be considered 
as publication quality, no assertion is made along those lines. This 
software has been written in the hope that it will be useful, 
especially for students in numerical analysis courses based on Fortran.

Documentation can be found [here](http://hornekyle.github.io/PlPlotLib).
